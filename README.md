# fcc-projects-js

These are my 5 solutions to the last exercises of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms certification.
I'm pretty proud of them and they are my first steps on JS programming.
I think it took me around 2 weeks to complete the whole certification.
If you're reading this, I know you can do it as well, you may find some lessons pretty difficult and hard to grasp at first but I promise you'll be able to overcome them. Don't give up <3
peace out
